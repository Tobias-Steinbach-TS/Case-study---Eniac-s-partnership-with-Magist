# Case study - Eniac's possible partnership with Magist
Business case study evaluating possible expansion into the Brazilian market with partner Magist / part of Data-Analyst-Bootcamp at WBS Coding School

## Summary
Group work analyzing a dataset and drawing conclusions on whether to expand in the Brazilian eCommerce-market with the help of Magist, a local marketplace / Findings were presented in the context of business presentation (3-4 minute long) / Our role was that of Eniac's data analyst

Eniac is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories assessing whether to sign a 3-year-contract to set foot in the Brazilian market. Upon finalizing the contract two major concerns arise:
1. Eniac’s catalogue is 100% tech products and heavily based on Apple-compatible accessories. It is not clear that Magist is a good partner for these high-end tech products.
2. Among Eniac’s efforts to have happy customers, fast deliveries are key. The delivery fees resulting from Magist’s deal with the public Post Office might be cheap, but at what cost? Are deliveries fast enough?

These concerns must be adressed with insights of the database and own research on the real Brazilian market.

## Tools
We explored the dataset with MySQL Workbench and used Tableau to visualize our findings for the presentation. Google Sheets served to draw the outlne of the presentation and Gamma created its basic framework

## Key Learnings
- Playing around with a dataset, approaching it by using queries in MySQL to define range, min/max values, interdependencies helped a lot in the beginning
- Displaying various relevant plots and charts in Tableau (always doublechecking the results in  MySQL) is a wonderful way to make your queries come to life / really enjoyed the layout part
- As in almost case, perspective can be used to make a point. The same dataset led to differing recommendation in various groups. Key was to orchestrate your findings, or even use and display only those, that support 
  your fictitious recommendation and align with your story

## Challenges Overcame
Getting a grip of the dataset was unfamiliar at first, defining relevant questions for the involved parties/stakeholders helped. Same goes for utilizing Tableau, but colleagues, forums and AI agents were a great support. Also had to get used to completely remote group work.

## Additional reflections
Since we're only at week 3 of our bootcamp, we're just scraping at the possibilities of the 2 mentioned programms. Tableau really felt like a potent data-visualization-toy. It was so cool seeing all these graphs appear and alter instantly. Looking forward to all this bootcamp has still in store!
